# Sentient.ai
## Working Plan
1. User comes to website and enters a handle or a hashtag
2. if handle:
   1. step 1: Search for tweets by the user and give engagement information.
   2. step 2: Search for tweets mentioning the user and give sentiment and emotional analysis.
3. if hashtag:
   1. Search for tweets with that hashtag and give sentiment and emotional analysis.

## Application Design
I would like to have a partially dynamic dashboard. For example, the information about current tweet should keep
updating in real time. Further I would like to have interactive Charts for the user.


## To-Do
1. Ping Server to check if entered handle exists.
